    "Machine learning in the real world: Much has been written about the Netflix Prize, and everyone may learn a lot by reading up on it. The techniques that won were a mixture of advanced machine learning and a lot of work put into preprocessing the data. For example, some users like to rate everything very highly, while others are always more negative; if this is not accounted in preprocessing, the model will suffer. Other normalizations were also necessary for a good result, bearing in mind factors such as the film's age and how many ratings it received. Good algorithms are a good thing, but it is always needed to get hands dirty and tune the methods to the properties of the data. Preprocessing and normalizing the data is often the most time-consuming part of the machine-learning process. However, this is also the place where one can have the biggest impact on the final performance of the system."

The goal was to obtain just another 10 percent improvement on this. In total, the winning system was roughly just 20 percent better than no personalization. Yet it took a tremendous amount of time and effort to achieve this goal, and even though 20 percent does not seem like much, the result is a system that is useful in practice."

Next is to choose the axis of normalization. By default, it is normalized along the first axis, but sometimes it will be useful to normalize along the second one. This follows the convention of many other NumPy-related functions. The most important method is the fit method. In the implementation, the mean and standard deviation of the values that are not zero is computed. Recall that zeros indicate missing values. 0.1 is added to the direct estimate of the standard deviation to avoid underestimating the value of the standard deviation when there are only a few samples, all of which may be exactly the same. The exact value used does not matter much for the final result, but it is needed to avoid division by zero. The transform method needs to take care of maintaining the binary structure. Note how to took care of transposing the input matrix when the axis is 1 and then transformed it back so that the return value has the same shape as the input. The inverse_transform method performs the inverse operation to transform. Finally, the fit_transform method is added, which, as the name indicates, combines both the fit and transform operations:"
